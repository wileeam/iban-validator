# IBAN validator

IBAN validator is a naive and simple Flask application serving a HTTP GET (and soon also HTTP POST) endpoint to check and validate one or more IBAN accounts.

## Installation

#### Prerequisites
You need to have, at least, `Python 3.10` and `pipenv` configured in your machine.

You may also want to have `Docker` configured when testing the corresponding container.

#### Instructions
Clone the `git`repository wherever you please and install the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file as follows,

```bash
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To launch the application locally, simply do the following,
```bash
pipenv shell
./local.sh
```
If you just want to launch the application via `Docker`, do the following instead,
```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Test
To test the application, simply do the following,
```bash
pipenv install pytest
pytest
```
If you want to run specific tests, do as follows,
```bash
